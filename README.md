# BattleshipGame
This was a lab assignment completed in a partner group with another student.
A program that simulates a game similar to Battleship. The user decides if they would first like to play the game, 
then enters a row and column to place their shot.  The user continues to play until they have hit the ship at all 
four spots, which means they have won the game.
This lab was assigned by Shannon Clearly in my CECS 277 Lab at CSULB.
